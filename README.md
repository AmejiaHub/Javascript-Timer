# Javascript-Timer

My personal project about creating a timer using Javascript: Albert Mejia

Project context

You need an online countdown timer that helps you controlling worktime and breaks, cooking, for power naps and so on. 
You want to create your own individual timer with your favourite design.

Project phases

1) Planning and research (Date and Math objects in Javascript) ---> W3Schools.com + Youtube Tutorials
2) Create mockup (mobile first) ---> Figma / create new design
3) Setup project resources --> VSC files, Git-Hub repository, Know-How Documentation
4) Program and test prototype with JavaScript: Timer, Countdown Timer, Timedefinition (Variable, Input Field, Datetime Field), 
   Start/Stop Buttons ---> VSC + Browser
6) Style the timer display and build the design around the prototype elements (mobile first) ---> Bootstrap5 + CSS
