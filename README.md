# Javascript-Timer

My personal project about creating a timer app for mobile phones using Javascript: Albert Mejia

Project context

You need an online countdown timer that helps you controlling worktime and breaks, cooking, for power naps and so on. 
You want to create your own individual timer with your favourite design.

Project phases

1) Planning and research (Date and Math objects in Javascript) ---> W3Schools.com + Youtube Tutorials

2) Create mockup (mobile first) ---> Figma / create new design

3) Setup project resources --> VSC files, Git-Hub repository, Know-How Documentation

4) Program and test prototype with JavaScript: Timer, Countdown Timer, Timedefinition (Variable,  Input Field, Datetime     Field), Start/Stop Buttons ---> VSC + Browser

6) Style the timer display and build the design around the prototype elements (mobile first) ---> Bootstrap5 + CSS

Project Description:

I made a simple mobile application containing 3 pages: 

a) Main page: where user can choose between 2 different types of timers and sees the current date & time on the top

I concidered the usage of this app with two methods:

- Usage of app only using thumb: when the user holds the phone one-handed

- Usage of app using both hands: when the user holds phone with one hand and selects things with the other hand, two-handed use.

b) Countdown Timer: using this timer the user can select the duration of countdown. I used a html form for it. At the end of countdown an alarm sound should go off; but not if the user presses the buttons "Stop" and "Reset".

c) Precise Stopwatch: the second timer consists in a countdown watch with which the user can do time-taking tasks.

App Layout / Color Palette:

The overall colors of this app was kept in dark-mode because of the following reasons: 

1) Many users use reading-glasses and the dark mode is better for the eye since it gives less blue light.

2) Its a current trend that users are using dark-mode themes on their phones. I only see users, using light-mode when it  comes to reading on the web browser of the phone.

This app can be used as a normal website, but was coded to be mainly responsive and look good on mobile phones.
